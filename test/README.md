# Hub Tests

Hub tests consist of following parts:
- Unit tests ```$ make test```
- REST API tests ```$ make test-api```

All tests can be executed with ```$ make test-all``` which will run all available tests.

For API E2E / integration tests, refer to https://github.com/konveyor/go-konveyor-tests

## General information

- Tests are written in golang to fit well to the Konveyor project components.
- Each test is responsible for setup its test data and clean it when finished.
- The main way of interacting with Hub is its API, to make testing easier, following tools are provided:
  - ```RichClient``` from [binding](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-hub/tree/main/binding) package that provides methods working with Hub resources (like ```RichClient.Application.Create(&testApp)```). This is a preffered option.
  - ```addon.Client``` provides API methods like Get/Post/etc. it can be accessed from ```RichClient.Client```
  - ```test/assertion``` package provides Should/Must and other equality assertions.
  - Hub's ```API``` package provides predefined routes and resources struct definition.


## REST API

API tests can be executed on locally running Hub in development mode (without other Konveyor components using DISCONNECTED=1).

```
$ export DISCONNECTED=1
$ make run
```

```
$ export HUB_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
$ go test -v ./test/api/
```

Or tests can run against running Konveyor installation (example with minikube below).

```
$ export HUB_BASE_URL="http://$(minikube ip)/hub"
$ export HUB_USERNAME="admin"
$ export HUB_PASSWORD="..."
$ go test -v ./test/api/
```

Sample output
```
$ make test-api 
echo "Using Hub API from http://192.168.39.236/hub"
Using Hub API from http://192.168.39.236/hub

### HTTPS

```binding.Client``` validates SSL certificate. In order to add not trusted CA, it is needed import certificate chain to the local machine.

The chain.pem file can be downloaded with ```openssl``` command and imported. Example:
```
# openssl s_client -showcerts -connect mta-openshift-mta.example.com:443 </dev/null | sed -n '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE-/,/-END CERTIFICATE-/p' > chain.pem
# cp chain.pem /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/
# update-ca-trust
```
