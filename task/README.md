## Manager ##

### Processing ###

The manager processes tasks at an interval defined by the
[Frequency.Task](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-hub/tree/main/settings#intervalsfrequencies) setting. 
1. Fetch cluster resources using a k8s cached client.
2. Process queued task delete and cancel requests.
3. Delete orphaned pods. Orphans are pod within the namespace with task 
   labels that does not correspond to a task in the running state.
4. Fetch running tasks; update their status based on the associated pod/container status.
5. Kill zombies. Zombies are _sidecar_ containers that have not terminated on their own after the
   _main_ (addon) container has terminated.
6. Fetch and run new (state=Ready) tasks:
   1. select addon. See: _Addons.Selection_.
   2. select extensions. See: _Extensions.Selection_.
   3. create pod. See: _Pods_.

### Priority ###

Tasks with state=Ready are started based on their `Priority` property.
Priority zero(0) is the lowest and the default. There is no maximum. The manager process tasks ordered by
priority. As a result, task pods are created in the order of priority. However, after the pod is created,
the pod scheduling order is at the discretion of the k8s node-scheduler. To maximize the influence of task
priority ordering, it is highly recommended for administrators to create a k8s _Resource Quota_ in the
namespace to restrict the number of pods created.

### Resource Quota ###

When a pod cannot be created due to quota restriction, the manager sets the state=_QuotaBlocked_ 
and a _QuotaBlocked_ event is reported on the task. The manager will attempt to create the pod in
every processing cycle.

### Priority Escalation ###

A task's priority may be escalated (increased) when one of its dependencies is also in the
set of tasks ready to be started. The goal is to prevent lower priority dependencies
from impeding higher priority tasks.

Example:

- Task id=10 (kind=A) (priority=0)
- Task id=12 (kind=B) (priority=1) depends on: `A`

When scheduling both tasks, task(12) cannot run until task(10) has completed. This
condition effectively makes task(12) priority=0. To prevent this, the manager
will _escalate_ task(10) priority=1 to match task(12). 

### Preemption ###

To prevent priority inversions, the manager supports preempting a _running_ task so that a
higher priority _ready_ task pod may be scheduled. Preemption is the act of killing (deleting)
the pod of a _running_ task, so that the higher _blocked_ task may be created/scheduled
by the node-scheduler. A task is considered _blocked_ when it cannot be created due to
a resource quota (state=QuotaBlocked) or cannot be scheduled by the node-scheduler
(state=Pending) for a defined duration defined by the 
[Preemption.Delayed](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-hub/tree/main/settings#task-manager) setting.
To trigger preemption, the _blocked_ task must have Policy.PreemptEnabled=TRUE. When
the need for preemption is detected, the manger will preempt a percentage
([Preemption.Rate](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-hub/tree/main/settings#task-manager)) 
of the newest, lower priority tasks processing cycle. To prevent _thrashing_ a preempted task will 
be postponed for a defined duration defined by the
[Preemption.Postponed](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-hub/tree/main/settings#task-manager) setting.
When a task is preempted:
1. The pod is deleted.
2. The task state is reset to Ready.
3. A `Preempted` event is recorded.

### Macros ###

The manager supports injecting values into Addon and Extension specifications. 
Each macro has the syntax of: ${_name_}.  

Supported:

- ${**seq**:_pool_} - Number sequence generator. The _pool_ is the identifier and the beginning number.
  Example usage for network port assignment:
  ```yaml
   PORT_A: ${seq:8000}
   PORT_B: ${seq:8000}
  ```
  Results in:
  ```yaml
  PORT_A: 8000
  PORT_B: 8001
   ```

### Pods ###

Tasks are executed using Kubernetes Pods. When a task is _state=Ready_ to run, the
manager creates a Pod resource which is associated to the task. Task pods have the
following labels:
- app:`tackle`
- role:`task`
- task: _id_

The manager injects a few environment variables:

| Name         | Definition                                                                                                                                                                             |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ADDON_HOME   | Path to an EmptyDir mounted as the working directory. Defined by the [HomeDir](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-hub/tree/main/settings#addon) setting.                              |
| SHARED_PATH  | Path to an EmptyDir mounted in all containers within the pod for sharing files. Defined by the [Shared.Path](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-hub/tree/main/settings#main) setting. |
| CACHE_PATH   | Path to a volume mounted in all containers in all pods for cached files. Defined by the [Cache.Path](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-hub/tree/main/settings#main) setting.         |
| HUB_BASE_URL | The hub API base url. Defined by the [Hub.URL](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-hub/tree/main/settings#addon) setting.                                                                                                                                  |
| TASK         | The task id (to be acted on).                                                                                                                                                          |
| TOKEN        | An authentication token for the hub API.                                                                                                                                               |

#### Retention ####

The pod associated with completed task is retained for a defined duration. After
which, the pod is deleted to prevent leaking pod resources indefinitely.

| State     | Retention (default)                                                                                |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Succeeded | [Pod.Retention.Succeeded](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-hub/tree/main/settings#task-manager) |
| Failed    | [Pod.Retention.Failed](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-hub/tree/main/settings#task-manager)    |

#### Containers ####

The pod is created with a _main_ container (0) for the selected addon using the image 
defined by the Addon CR. Additional _sidecar_ containers are created for each extension
selected as defined by the Extension CR. After the _main_ (addon) container has terminated,
the manager will kill extension contains should they not terminate on their own. This is to
ensure complete termination of the pod after the addon container has terminated.

#### Log Collection ####

The manager _tails_ the log for each contain in the task pod. Each is stored as `File` in the
inventory and associated with the task as an attachment. The file is named using the
convention of the _container-name_.yaml.

## Task ##

Tasks are used to execute Addons.

### Policies ###

The task supports policies designed to influence scheduling.

| Name           | Definition                                               |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Isolated       | ALL other tasks are postponed while the task is running. |
| PreemptEnabled | When (true), the task _may_ trigger preemption.          |
| PreemptExempt  | When (true), the task may NOT be preempted.              |


### TTL (Time-To-Live) ###

The TTL determines how long at task may exist in a given state before the task
or associated resources are reaped.

## (Task) Kinds ###

The `Task` CR defines a name kind of task. Each kind may define:
- **Priority** - The default priority.
- **Dependencies** - List of dependencies (other task kinds). When created/ready concurrent,
  A task's dependencies must complete before the task is scheduled.
- **Metadata** - **TBD**.  

## Addons ##

An `Addon` CR defines a named addon (aka plugin). It defines functionality provide by an image to 
be executed. The definition includes a container specification and selection criteria. An addon 
may have extensions. See: [_Extensions_](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-hub/tree/main/task#extensions).

### Selection ###

When a task is created, either the `kind` or the `addon` may be specified. When the
`addon` is specified, the addon is selected by matching the name. When the `kind` is specified,
the addon is selected by matching the `Addon.Task` and evaluating the `Addon.Selector`.

## Extensions ##

An extension defines an additional _sidecar_ container to be included in the task pod.

### Selection ###

When a task is created, it may define a list of extensions. When specified, addons are
selected by name. When not specified, addons are selected by matching the `Extension.Addon`
and evaluating the `Extension.Selector`. The selector includes logical `||` and `&&` operators
and `()` parens for grouping expressions.

Supported selector:
- tag:_category_=_tag_ - match application tags.
  ```yaml
  spec:
    addon: ^(analyzer|tech-discovery)$
    selector: tag:Language=Java
  ```

## Authorization ##

When the task pod is created and _Auth_ is enabled, a token is generated with the
necessary scopes. The token is mounted as a secret in the pod. The token is only 
valid while the task is running. 

## Reaping ###

A task may be reaped after existing in a state for the defined duration. 
This is to prevent orphaned or stuck tasks from leaking resources such as buckets and files.

| State     | Duration (default)                                                                          | Action   |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Created   | [Reaper.Created](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-hub/tree/main/settings#task-manager)   | Deleted  |
| Succeeded | [Reaper.Succeeded](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-hub/tree/main/settings#task-manager) | Deleted  |
| Failed    | [Reaper.Failed](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-hub/tree/main/settings#task-manager)    | Released |

See [Reaper](https://github.com/konveyor/tackle2-hub/blob/main/reaper/README.md#reaper)
settings for details.

### Group ###

Task groups are used to create collections of tasks.

#### Modes ####

- Batch (default) - Used to create a _batch_ of un-ordered, homogeneous tasks. When the group is submitted, each member
  (task) is created. As part of task creation, group properties (kind, addon, extension, priority, policy, data) are 
  propagated to each member. The `Data` object is _merged_ into each Task.Data with Task.Data values taking precedent.
  Members (tasks) share group's bucket.
- Pipeline - Used to create a collection of heterogeneous tasks to be executed in order. When the group is submitted, 
  each member (task) is created and the FIRST task's state is set to Ready. No other properties are propagated. 
  As each task completes (state=Succeeded), the next task's state is set to Ready. 
  Members (tasks) share group's bucket.


| Name        | Definition                                                                                                         |
